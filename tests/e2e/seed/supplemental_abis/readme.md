## Overview

This directory is intended to contain minter contracts that are not included in the latest @artblocks/contracts package, but are needed for end-to-end testing.

For example, if a new contract is still in development, but is needed for testing, it can be added here.

Once a contract is included in the latest @artblocks/contracts package, it should be removed from this directory.
